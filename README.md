## To install required software and packages

### Step 1: Cygwin:
    * Download __Cygwin__ from [here](https://cygwin.com/install.html) by 
Left-clicking *setup-x86_64.exe* (I would recommend to save this installation 
file on the Desktop in case some other packages or softwares are needed in the future).
    * Install __Cygwin__ by:
        + Keep clicking __Next__ button until __Select Packages__.
        + Click on the dropdown list of ``View'', and then select ``Full''.
        + In ``Search'', type in <code>Python3</code> and wait for the list 
to update.
        + Four packages are needed and they are listed below. Click ``Skip'' 
under New'' column, and select the newest version to install.
            1. <code>python3-devel: Py3K language interpreter</code> 
            2. <code>python3-ipython: Interactive Python interpreter</code>
            3. <code><python3-pip: Python package installation tool/code>
